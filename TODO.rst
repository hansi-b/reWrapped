TODO
====

#. perhaps just wire the `methods of the MatchObject interface <https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/re.html#match-objects>`_
   into the rewrap instances?
#. more utility modders like split, join, etc.
#. what about more interesting regular expressions
  #. add support for named groups
  #. prevent confusion for groups from alternatives like "(ab)|(cd)"
#. better exception handling: currently, we throw AssertionErrors
